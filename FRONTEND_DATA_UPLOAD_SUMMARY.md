## 🔧 **Technical Process**

### Step 1: Data Extraction
- Analyzed all frontend components and service files
- Extracted structured data from:
  - React components (.tsx files)
  - API service files (.ts files)  
  - Mock data arrays

### Step 2: Data Transformation
- Created properly formatted JSON files matching database schema
- Applied data type conversions and field mappings
- Generated additional fields like timestamps and IDs

### Step 3: Database Upload
- Used direct database import scripts (`db-manager.ts`)
- Bypassed API authentication issues
- Imported data directly into MySQL tables

### Step 4: Verification
- Confirmed all data uploaded successfully
- Database tables populated correctly
- Ready for admin interface access

# View database statistics
npm run db-script stats

# Get specific table data
npm run db-script get programs
npm run db-script get coaches
npm run db-script get achievements
npm run db-script get facilities
npm run db-script get gallery_images

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test Admin Dashboard:** Open `admin-dashboard.html` and verify data display
2. **API Testing:** Ensure API endpoints return the uploaded data correctly
3. **Frontend Integration:** Connect frontend components to use database data instead of mock data
4. **Data Management:** Use admin interface to add, edit, or manage the imported data
5. **Backup:** Export data regularly using the provided scripts

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### If data doesn't appear in admin dashboard:
1. Verify backend server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. Check database connection in `.env` file
3. Test API endpoints individually
4. Use database scripts to verify data exists

### If you need to re-upload data:
1. Clear existing data: Manually delete from admin dashboard
2. Re-run upload: Use the created JSON files and db-script import commands
3. Verify: Check database stats and admin dashboard
