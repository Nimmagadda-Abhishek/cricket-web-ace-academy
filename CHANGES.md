# Changes Made to Fix Issues and Prepare for Deployment

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Missing Database Tables**
   - Created a script to check for missing tables (`scripts/check-db-tables.js`)
   - Added code to automatically create the missing tables (testimonials, facilities, gallery)

2. **Server Issues**
   - Created a fixed version of the server (`server/fixed-server.js`)
   - Updated the server to listen on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)
   - Added better error handling for server startup

3. **Admin Dashboard Not Working**
   - Identified the issue: browser-side database operations not working
   - Created server-side API endpoints for admin operations (`server/routes/admin.js`)
   - Updated the API client to use the new endpoints (`src/services/admin-api.ts`)
   - Created a client-side admin service that uses the API endpoints (`src/services/admin-client.ts`)
   - Modified the Hostinger service to use the new admin client service

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Created a production build script (`scripts/build-for-production.js`)
   - Added a deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)
   - Updated package.json with new scripts

## Files Created

1. `scripts/check-db-tables.js` - Script to check and create missing database tables
2. `server/fixed-server.js` - Improved server implementation with better error handling
3. `server/routes/admin.js` - Server-side API endpoints for admin operations
4. `src/services/admin-api.ts` - Server-side service for admin operations
5. `src/services/admin-client.ts` - Client-side service for admin operations using the API
6. `scripts/build-for-production.js` - Script to build the project for production
7. `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Guide for deploying the application
8. `CHANGES.md` - Summary of changes made

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Added new scripts for server, testing, and production build
2. `src/lib/api.ts` - Added admin API endpoints
3. `src/services/hostinger.ts` - Updated to use the new admin API service

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the admin dashboard functionality
   - Verify that all API endpoints are working correctly
   - Test the file upload functionality

2. **Deployment**
   - Follow the steps in the deployment guide
   - Set up the production environment
   - Configure domain and SSL

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring for the production environment
   - Monitor server logs for errors
   - Track database performance

## Conclusion

The project has been fixed and prepared for deployment. The main issues were related to missing database tables and the admin dashboard not working due to browser-side database operations. These issues have been resolved by creating server-side API endpoints and updating the client-side code to use these endpoints.
